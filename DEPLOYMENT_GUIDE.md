# MLX Distributed Training - Deployment Guide

## Repository Setup Complete âœ…

The MLX distributed training code has been successfully migrated to its own repository:
https://github.com/lyzetam/mlx-distributed-training

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Created a clean repository structure** with proper organization:
   - `scripts/` - Core training scripts
   - `config/` - Configuration files
   - `utils/` - Training utilities
   - `data/` - Example datasets

2. **Migrated working code** from the mlx-project:
   - The proven `fine_tune_distributed.py` that successfully trains across 3 nodes
   - All supporting utilities and configurations
   - Example data for quick testing

3. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
   - Clear troubleshooting guide
   - Example code for using the trained models

## Using the Trained Models

### Option 1: Direct MLX Usage
```python
from mlx_lm import load, generate

model, tokenizer = load(
    "mlx-community/gemma-2-2b-it-4bit",
    adapter_path="/path/to/adapters/distributed/"
)

response = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt="turn on the lights", max_tokens=50)
```

### Option 2: Containerized Deployment

For containerized deployment, you would need:

1. **Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install MLX and dependencies
RUN pip install mlx mlx-lm fastapi uvicorn

# Copy model adapters
COPY adapters /app/adapters

# Copy inference server
COPY server.py /app/

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

2. **Inference Server** (server.py):
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from mlx_lm import load, generate

app = FastAPI()

# Load model once at startup
model, tokenizer = load(
    "mlx-community/gemma-2-2b-it-4bit",
    adapter_path="/app/adapters"
)

@app.post("/generate")
async def generate_text(prompt: str, max_tokens: int = 50):
    response = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens)
    return {"response": response}
```

## Key Advantages of LoRA Adapters

- **Small size**: Adapters are only a few MB vs GB for full models
- **Portable**: Easy to deploy and update
- **Efficient**: Can swap adapters for different tasks without reloading base model

## Next Steps

1. Train your model using the distributed setup
2. Copy the adapter files from `adapters/distributed/`
3. Deploy using one of the methods above
4. Scale horizontally by running multiple inference containers

The trained adapters are the key output - they contain all the fine-tuning improvements and can be easily deployed anywhere the base model is available.
